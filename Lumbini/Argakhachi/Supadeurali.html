The temple is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in the region, and it is believed to have been built during the Licchavi period (400-750 CE).

The temple was built on the spot where Supa is believed to have meditated and performed penance to attain divine powers.
        
        The temple underwent several renovations and restorations over the centuries, including during the reign of the Malla kings in the 16th century and during the Rana dynasty in the 19th century. The current temple structure was built in the mid-20th century, and it is a two-story pagoda-style temple with a gold-plated pinnacle.

Thousands of devotees from all over Nepal and neighboring India visit the temple during this time to offer their prayers and seek the blessings of the goddess Supa Deurali.
